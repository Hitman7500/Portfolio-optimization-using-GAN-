# GAN-Optimized Portfolio Evaluation

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) applied to portfolio optimization, specifically focused on the Nifty Bank stocks. The goal is to use GANs to generate optimized portfolios and compare them with historical best portfolios. The project evaluates the out-of-sample performance of both historical and GAN-generated portfolios on multiple test sets.

### Key Components:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Historical stock data is divided into multiple training and test splits to evaluate the performance of portfolios generated by GANs.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A GAN framework is used to generate stock weights, and a discriminator evaluates their returns.
- **Comparison Metrics:** The GAN-optimized portfolios are compared with historical best portfolios in terms of returns, weights, and stock selections.
